## Installation and Execution
### 1. Clone the Repository (Optional)
If you want to clone this project from a GitHub repository, use the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/karinalorenzo/javaLoops
cd multiplication-table
```

### 2. Build the project
Navigate to the project directory and run:
```sh
mvn clean install

```

### 3. Run the Program
You can run the main application by executing the App class. Here are two ways to do it:

Using your IDE: Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse), navigate to App.java, and run the main method.
Using the command line:

```sh
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="dev.karina.java_loops.App"
```
### Running Tests

```sh
mvn test
```

## How to Use the Program
The App class demonstrates how to generate and print a multiplication table for a given integer n. By default, it uses n = 5, but you can modify this value to generate tables for different integers.
Example console output:

Example
For n = 5, the output will be:

```sh
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```
